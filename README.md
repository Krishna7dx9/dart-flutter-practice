# dart-flutter-practice
Daily coding practice to improve programming skills and track learning progress.

# My Daily Coding Practice 💻

This repo is my personal playground for coding.  
Every day, I solve problems, try out small programs, and experiment with concepts to get better at programming.  

No fancy projects, no perfect code — just practice, mistakes, and learning.  

## How I Use This Repo
- Each folder/file is a day or a topic I practiced.
- I track my progress and revisit old exercises to improve.
- Ideas, tests, and random experiments go here.

## Why This Repo Exists
- To stay consistent with coding every day.
- To see how much I’ve learned over time.
- To have a personal reference for concepts and solutions.

> “Practice doesn’t make perfect. Practice makes progress.” 🚀
